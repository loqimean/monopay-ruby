# MonopayRuby

The "monopay-ruby" gem simplifies Monobank payment integration in Ruby and Rails applications. It provides an intuitive interface and essential functionalities for generating payment requests, verifying transactions, handling callbacks, and ensuring data integrity. With this gem, you can quickly and securely implement Monobank payments, saving development time and delivering a seamless payment experience to your users.

This gem was developed for Monobank API [https://api.monobank.ua/docs/acquiring.html](https://api.monobank.ua/docs/acquiring.html)

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add "monopay-ruby"
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```ruby
gem install "monopay-ruby"
```

## Usage

Add API token. There are two ways:
First - add to the initializer file:

```ruby
# config/initializers/monopay-ruby.rb
MonopayRuby.configure do |config|
  config.api_token = "your_api_token"
end
```

The second one - add to the environment variable:

```bash
# .env
MONOPAY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
```

#### You can get the API token depending on the environment:

Production: [https://fop.monobank.ua/](https://fop.monobank.ua/)

Just get the token and go to earn moneys! ðŸš€

### Generate payment request

```ruby
# app/controllers/payments_controller.rb
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    payment = MonopayRuby::Invoices::SimpleInvoice.new(
      "https://example.com",
      "https://example.com/payments/webhook"
    )

    if payment.create(amount: 100, destination: "Payment description",)
      # your success code processing
    else
      # your error code processing
      # flash[:error] = payment.error_messages
    end
  end
end
```

## Generate advanced payment request:

```ruby
# app/controllers/payments_controller.rb
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    payment = MonopayRuby::Invoices::AdvancedInvoice.new(
      redirect_url: "https://example.com",
      webhook_url: "https://example.com/payments/webhook"
    )

    if payment.create(amount, additional_params: {})
      # your success code processing
    else
      # your error code processing
      # flash[:error] = payment.error_messages
    end
  end
end
```

`additional_params` - [Read more about params](https://api.monobank.ua/docs/acquiring.html)

### Verify transaction

```ruby
# app/controllers/payments_controller.rb
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token, only: :webhook

  def webhook
    webhook_validator = MonopayRuby::Webhooks::Validator.new(request)

    if webhook_validator.valid?
      # your success code processing
    else
      # your error code processing
      # flash[:error] = webhook_validator.error_messages
    end
  end
